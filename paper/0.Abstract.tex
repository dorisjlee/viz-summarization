%%\abstract{The task of navigating through a large, multidimensional dataset is a common challenge in data analytics. Not only is manual drill-down and roll-up on data subsets tedious and inefficient for the analyst, but even with all the information given, there is no systematic and effective way for an analyst to make sense of and navigate through the large space of possible visualizations. We present \system, an interactive visualization recommendation system that automatically selects k visualizations to tell an interesting, connected, and informative story to the user. Given a dataset, \system\ intelligently explores a lattice of equivalent visualizations across data subsets and recommend visualizations based on an intuitive user-expectation model. The recommended visualization is displayed in an interactive dashboard where the visualizations are organized into hierarchical graph layout. Our evaluation study shows that visualization dashboards generated by \system\ were more interpretable and resulted in higher performance in data analytic tasks among our users compared to other competing baselines.}

%\title{Navigating Filter Space with \system : Informative and Insightful Summary of Visualizations across Data Subsets}
%\abstract{Searching for similar (and dissimilar) patterns in hundreds of data subsets is a common exercise in many data science tasks, including feature selection, outlier detection, and funnel analysis. There are several challenges that makes this exercise particularly hard---the massive space of data subsets (even for a modest dataset with a few hundred attributes), the lack of interesting patterns in most data subsets, the fallacies of spurious correlations, the pitfalls of statistical paradoxes (e.g., Simpson's paradox) are some of the key challenges. In this paper, we present \system , an interactive visualization recommendation system that automates the \lq\lq pattern exploration\rq\rq\ exercise by presenting an interesting and informative summary of trends to the user. Given a dataset and the x and y axes of interest, \system\ intelligently explores the lattice of equivalent visualizations across data subsets, and recommends interesting and informative visualizations based on an intuitive user-expectation model. The recommended visualizations are then displayed in an interactive dashboard, where the visualizations are organized into a hierarchical layout. We performed an extensive user study to show that the dashboards generated by \system\ are interpretable and leads to higher performance in data analytic tasks compared to the competing baselines.}
