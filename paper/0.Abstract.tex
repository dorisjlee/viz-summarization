\title{\system : Interactive Exploration of Multi-dimensional Datasets Through Hierarchical Summary Visualizations}
\abstract{The task of navigating through a large, multidimensional dataset is a common challenge in data analytics. Not only is manual drill-down and roll-up on data subsets tedious and inefficient for the analyst, but even with all the information given, there is no systematic and effective way for an analyst to make sense of and navigate through the large space of possible visualizations. We present \system, an interactive visualization recommendation system that automatically selects k visualizations to tell an interesting, connected, and informative story to the user. Given a dataset, \system\ intelligently explores a lattice of equivalent visualizations across data subsets and recommend visualizations based on an intuitive user-expectation model. The recommended visualization is displayed in an interactive dashboard where the visualizations are organized into hierarchical graph layout. Our evaluation study shows that visualization dashboards generated by \system\ were more interpretable and resulted in higher performance in data analytic tasks among our users compared to other competing baselines.}
