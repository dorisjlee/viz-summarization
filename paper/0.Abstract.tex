\abstract{ The task of navigating through a large, multidimensional dataset is a common challenge in data analytics. Not only is manual drill-down and roll-up on data subsets tedious and inefficient for the analyst, but even with all the information given, there is no systematic and effective way for an analyst to make sense of and navigate through the large space of possible visualizations. We present \system, an interactive visualization recommendation system to summarize visualizations across data subsets. Given a dataset, \system\ intelligently explores a lattice of equivalent visualizations across data subsets, evaluates the trends of these visualizations with respect to their predecessors in the lattice, and recommends those it deems \lq\lq informative\rq\rq\ and \lq\lq interesting\rq\rq.  ----- displayed a hierarchical structure to organize the recommended visualizations into an interactive visual dashboard. Our user study shows that visual stories generated by \system }
