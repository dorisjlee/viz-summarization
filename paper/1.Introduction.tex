\section{Introduction}
\par The goal of visual analysis is to extract meaningful stories or insights from the data. Individual visualizations represent simple ``factoids'' portraying one aspect of the data. Meaningful insights arise when a group of factoids work in conjunction, along with human interpretation, to produce informative and interesting facts. 
\par However, without knowing \textit{what} subset of the data would be interesting to visualize, the manual drill-down and roll-ups on all possible filter combinations can be tedious and inefficient for analysts. In many data analytics scenarios, analysts have an x and y axis of interest and want to explore data subsets corresponding to different filtering criteria. For example, a campaign manager may be interested in looking at bar chart visualizations of x as the voted candidate and y as the \% of votes for the 2016 US elections exit polls with different filter combinations on demographics information, such as gender, income, race, states, and responses to different survey questions\footnote{\url{https://edition.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls}} . The analyst would have to compare across a combinatorially large space of different data subsets by iteratively changing the filter criterion of a visualization to understand how the relationship between the x and y variables change across data subsets. Even if the analyst had plotted visualizations for all possible data subsets, currently there is no systematic and effective way for an analyst to make sense of and navigate through the large space of possible visualizations to draw meaningful insights. 
\par In this paper, we present \system, an interactive visualization summarization system that algorithmically generate dashboards of visualizations. The idea of picking a small set of visualizations to summarize the dataset is motivated by the observation that most of the data distributions in a dataset can be explained by a much smaller set of visualization instances\footnote{This principle is more generally known as the 80-20 rule in economics, e.g. 80\% of the wealth (effect) is held by approximately 20\% of the population (cause).}. For example, ----\% of all visualizations with x=candidate and y=\% of votes have distributions similar to White within (some delta ---\%) as shown in Figure 1--, while the rest of -----. When analysts inspect informative visualizations that cover these insights, they associate particular sets of attributes to typical trends and observed patterns. We define this notion of dataset understanding as \emph{distribution awareness}. Since human analysts have limited memory and attention, it is often impossible to visualize all possible data subsets. An ideal summarization system should display visualizations that enables users to gain maximal distribution awareness of the typical trends within a dataset. 
\par However, finding effective visualizations to summarize a dataset is a non-trivial problem, since picking individual visualizations that maximizes some statistical measure, such as deviation-based shape diversity or significance testing, can often result in misleading summarizations. Consider an elections campaign manager who is allocating the advertisement budget to be spent on different demographic populations to target for an upcoming election by investigating the voting patterns across different demographic groups. He performs a randomized permutation testing between the gender and race attributes and finds that the voting pattern of black females is drastically different from the voting pattern of general female population and allocates the his advertisement funds to target the black female population. \dor{Himel, can you check if this example makes sense? or should we say chi2? chi2 just give you columnar correlation info not at the attribute-level info? although probably only a deviation based comparison can give you a comparison like this.} While black females do defy the trends of general females, the comparison is incomplete, since it ignores the fact that black females follows very closely to the distribution of the voting behavior of the black population, so the proper subpopulation to target should be the black population rather than the more specific black female population.
\par The above example showcases a scenario where the selection of an improper reference (female) for comparing the visualization (black female) against results in misleading insights. Unlike prior work that defines interestingness based on distributional deviation~\cite{Vartak2015,Anand2015}, we argue that a visualization is \emph{actually} interesting when it deviates from and can not be explained by \emph{even} its most informative reference. Our user study results described in Section~\ref{sec:userstudy} show that this notion of informative interestingness can guide an analyst towards more meaningful stories for further investigation.
