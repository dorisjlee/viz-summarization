\caption{Overview of the \system interface for the Police Dataset. Users can select x and y axes of interest, as well as a choice of an aggregation function. Default values are set for system related parameters such as the number of visualizations to show in the dashboard (k), iceberg condition for pruning ($\delta$), and informative parent criterion ($\theta$), which can be adjusted by the users via the sliders if needed.}

\end{figure}
\par Figure \ref{fig:overview} shows an overview of the \system interface. After the user selects the x and y axes of interest, aggregation function, and optional system parameter settings, an initial dashboard of $k$ visualizations is displayed on the canvas, such as the one seen in main canvas of Figure \ref{fig:overview}.  The system provides toolbar buttons with keyboard binding for zooming in, out, and extent, as well as moving around the canvas. Alternatively, users can also zoom and pan with mouse click and scroll.

\hdev{(1) The second sentence is in passive voice. (2) What are the optional system parameters? Clearly state them. (1) Simplify the third sentence. A non-UI person may not know the meaning of some of the terms. (1) In fourth sentence, if you are using "alternatively", there's no need for "also".}

\par After browsing through the visualizations the dashboard, users may be interested in getting more information about a particular node. \system supports a mechanism for users to request additional summarizations based on a chosen node of interest. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:altroot_expansion}, the analyst starts a 5-visualization dashboard. He learns that for the drivers who had contraband found in the vehicle, the arrest rate for drivers who are 60 and over is surprisingly higher than usual, whereas for Asian drivers the arrest rate is lower. Apart from the contraband found stories, he is also interested in learning more about the other factor that contribute to high arrest rate: duration=30+min. He clicks on the corresponding visualization and requests for 2 additional visualizations. Upon seeing the updated dashboard, he learns that unlike the contraband found story, the child distributions of the duration=30+min distribution largely follows its parent distribution, which implies that if a police stop last more than 30 minutes, the outcome would more or less be the same, independent of other factors, such as driver's race or age. The system uses the same models and algorithms as discussed earlier to generate the expansion dashboard, with the only difference that the starting node is now the selected visualization, rather than the overall visualization. This node expansion capability is similarly motivated by the idea of \textit{iterative view refinement} in other visual analytics system\cite{Wongsuphasawat2016,Hoque2017}, which is essential for the users to iterate on and explore different hypotheses. 

\hdev{(1) In the first sentence, there is a missing preposition before "the dashboard". (2) In second sentence and following, "node" or "visualization"? "node" is appropriate when discussing algorithms, but for UI you can use "visualization" instead. (3) In the third sentence, there is a missing "with" after "starts". (4) "Apart from the contraband found stories" does not connect well with the following phrase. Just say that he is interested in investigating other strong indicators of arrest. (5) "the child distributions of the duration=30+min distribution largely follows its parent distribution" is confusing. Simply say "the distribution of stop outcomes when stop duration is greater than 30 minutes is highly skewed towards arrest, irrespective of the other factors". Note that, the reader is not aware of the attributes in this dataset. Therefore, an intuitive explanation will be a lot more appreciated. (6) "The system uses the same models and algorithms as discussed earlier to generate the expansion dashboard, with the only difference that the starting node is now the selected visualization, rather than the overall visualization" --- you can simply say "The system uses the same models and algorithms as before, with the exception of the root node, which is now the selected visualization." (7) One thing that I noticed so far is you tend to write a lot of comprehensive standalone sentences, with many clarifications. While clarifications allow a reader to resolve ambiguity, they could also distract readers. They tend to de-highlight the key message of a sentence. My suggestion is to provide clarifications, only when it's absolutely required. In other cases, the sentence neighborhood should provide your reader enough context. (8) Another suggestion is to use singular subject such as "a user" to describe a scenario/example, instead of a plural subject "users". The latter often require more clarifications.}

\subsection{Assistive tools for visualizing large lattices\label{sec:navigation}}
Due to the amount of space occupied by the hierarchical layout when the number of visualizations gets large, we have developed tools to help users navigate through different parts of the dashboard interactively. 
\stitle{Navigation Minimap:}  When the user zooms in on the dashboard, an overview mini-map is shown on the upper right-hand side of the canvas to help users identify which region of the dashboard they are currently exploring, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hover_minimap}. 
\stitle{Collapsed visualizations:} 
One observation that we found across several datasets was that many visualizations had identical distributions, which resulted in lots of wasted space. Apart from their attribute name, these visualizations are not very informative for the users, therefore, we offer an option to collapse these visualization, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:collapse_demo}. A visualization can be collapsed if it has more than one redundant sibling and does not have any children, so that there are no hidden stories due to lower-level dependencies. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:hover_minimap}, collapsed nodes can be easily identified by an orange border and the details of which visualizations are in the collapsed node are displayed when the user hovers over the visualization.
