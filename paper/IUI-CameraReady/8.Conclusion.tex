\section{Conclusion}
\par Common analytics tasks, such as causal inference, feature selection, and outlier detection require studying data distributions at different levels of data granularity~\cite{Anand2015,Heer2012,Wu2013,Hullman2017}. However, without knowing \textit{what} subset of data contains an insightful distribution, manually exploring distributions from all possible data subsets can be tedious and inefficient. Moreover, when examining data subsets by adding one filter at a time, analysts can fall prey to the drill-down fallacy, where they mistakenly attribute the interestingness of a visualization to a ``local difference'', while overlooking a more general explanation for the root cause of the behavior. To address these issues, we presented \system, an interactive visualization recommendation system that automatically selects a small set of informative and interesting visualizations to summarize key distributions within a dataset. Our user study demonstrates that \system can guide analysts towards more informed decisions for retrieving interesting visualizations, judging the relative importance of attributes, and predicting unseen visualizations, than compared to two \change{other baselines}. Study participants also find dashboard generated by \system to be more interpretable and ``human-like'', leading to more discovered insights. Our work is one of the first automated systems that guides analysts across the space of data subsets by summarizing key insights with safety guarantees---a step towards our grander vision of developing intelligent tools for accelerating and assisting with visual data discovery.
