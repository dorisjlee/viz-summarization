We present {\tt VizInNuce}, an interactive visualization recommendation ({\tt VizRec}) system to summarize patterns or trends: given a subset of data and attributes to be studied, {\tt VizInNuce} intelligently explores the lattice of visualizations, evaluates the trends of visualizations with respect to their predecessors in the lattice, and recommends those it deems most \lq\lq interesting\rq\rq\ and \lq\lq informative\rq\rq. Motivated by collaborations with domain scientists who search for patterns or trends in hundreds of subsets of data, {\tt VizInNuce} automatically recommends appropriate visualizations based on \lq\lq interestingness\rq\rq\ and \lq\lq informativeness\rq\rq, and adopts a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure to organize the recommended visualizations into an interactive visual dashboard.
